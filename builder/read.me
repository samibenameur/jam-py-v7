This folder contains the Application Builder project, which is used to
create the Jam.py Application Builder.

After making and testing changes, click the "Prepare files" button. The
application will create a “jam_files” folder, if it does not exist, with
files that should be copied to the jam folder of the Jam.py package with:
cp -fr jam_files/* ../jam/.

After copying, increase jam/__init__.py with th version number and test with:
pip install .

The development process is similar to the development of a regular
Jam.py application, except that all server code must be located in the
task server module.

All functions in this module that are called from client code using the
server method should be registered in the register_events function at
the end of the module using the register method, and server item events
should be defined in this function.
