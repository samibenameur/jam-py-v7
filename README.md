## Jam.py is a web front-end application generator that works with both existing databases and newly created ones.

## This is forked jam.py to continue the support and development, since Andrew is retiring from jam.py project. The GH organisation name is jam.py-v5, since we are hoping to release official v7 this year (2025). 

## The LLMS-full.txt is released: 
https://jampy-docs-v7.readthedocs.io/en/latest/llms-full.txt 
and 
https://jampy-docs-v7.readthedocs.io/en/latest/llms.txt

All batteries included and event driven! What is EDA:

"An event-driven framework, also known as event-driven architecture (EDA), is a design pattern where software components communicate and react to changes in state or events." Everything in Jam.py can be an event. Like a mouse click, or pressing CRTL+Ins, CTRL+Del or whatever is defined by you.

Major difference from other products is that the entire application is contained within a **single SQLite3 file**. And it can be **encrypted**! 

Another key distinction is the ability to run **any Python procedure directly within the Application Builder as a back-end** - including popular libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy - with the results displayed in the browser. Python procedure can run **synchronously** or **asynchronously** on the server. 

More over, using **Import tables** feature from any supported database is providing **instant web front-end**. There's no need to code anything and **authentication is one click away**! 

Hope this sparked some interest! Thank you.

## Main features

Jam.py is an object oriented, event driven framework with hierarchical structure, modular design
and very tight DB/GUI coupling. The server side of Jam.py is written in [Python](https://www.python.org),
the client utilizes [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript),
[jQuery](https://jquery.com) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/).

* Simple, clear and efficient IDE. The development takes place in the
  Application builder, an application written completely in Jam.py.

* “All in the browser” framework. With Jam.py, all you need are two pages
  in the browser, one for the project, the other for the Application builder.
  Make changes in the Application builder, go to the project, refresh the page,
  and see the results.

* Supports SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebird, MSSQL and
  Oracle databases. The concept of the framework allows you to migrate from
  one database to another without changing the project.

* Authentication, authorization, session management, roles and permissions.

* Automatic creation and modification of database tables and SQL queries generation.

* Data-aware controls.

* Open framework. You can use any Javascript/Python libraries.

* Rich, informative reports. Band-oriented report generation based on
  [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) templates.

* Charts. You can use free [jsCharts](http://www.jscharts.com) library
  or any javascript charting library to create charts to represent and analyze your application data.

* Allows to save audit trail/change history made by users

* Predefined css themes.

* Develop and test locally update remotely. Jam.py has Export and Import
  utilities that allow developer to store all metadata (database structures,
  project parameters and code) in a file that can be loaded by another
  application to apply all the changes.
